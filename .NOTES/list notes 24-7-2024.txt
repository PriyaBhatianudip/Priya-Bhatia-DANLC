=> How to create a list
syntax:-
listname = [value1, value2, value3, value4,,,,,valuen]
To create an empty list
listname = []

=> How to Add elements to the list
-> append() method is used to add single value to the list
syntax :-
	listname.append(value)

-> extend() method is used to multiple values(another list) to the list
syntax
		listname.extend(sublist)
	-> first create another list
		eg mainlist =[33,55,77,899]
		   sublist= [1,2,3,4,5]
		   mainlist.extend(sublist)
Slicing : means extracting a particular part of the list or get some elements, then we use slicing.
Syntax:
	listname[start:stop:step]
eg  list1[2:5]
