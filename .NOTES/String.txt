String : it is a sequence of characters which is used to store textual data. String can be stored either in single quotes, double quotes or multiline strings can be enclosed in triple quotes.
In String the index starts from 0.
To define a string
stringvar = "value"
stringvar = 'value'

To get a character from string  :-  stringvar[index]
To get more than one character : -  stringvar[sindex:endindex+1]

* if we provide negative index then it prints the value from the last of string. for example -1 represents the last character in the string
* to print a string in the reverse order without using loop :  var[::-1]
Slicing : to get a part of string based on given criteria
syntax:-
     to get a particular part of string :-  var[sindex:eindex]
*  if we do not provide any end index, then it automatically takes last index of the string
* if we do not provide the start index, then by default it takes 0 as first index.
* we can provide step value in between to skip values
var[sindex:eindex:stepvalue]

* Special string operators
	-  Concatenate operator(+) : join two strings
	eg fname = "Jai Kumar"
		lname="Sharma"
	print(fname+" "+lname)
result =  Jai KumarSharma
	Jai Kumar Sharma
Repetition (*): The * operator allows you to repeat a string a specified number of times
syntax:
	var * number of repetitions
print(var * number of repetitions)
result = var * number of repetitions
Membership operator - in and not in
in ->  searchstring in mainstring
not in-> searchstring not in mainstring
