Functions :- it is a block of code which can be executed whenever needed in the program. it simplifies the code by dividing all the tasks into sub-modules. it also allows us to reuse a function again and again, thus it reduces space and increases efficiency of the program.

Two types of functions:-
1. Inbuilt functions : - these functions are already defined in the programming language and can be used easily anytime.

2. User-Defined functions :- 

syntax :-
def functionname(parameters):
	code
	return statement
Loops :-
 it is used to repeat a set of instructions, until it satisfies a particular condition. 
1. for loop   : - when we know number of iterations or when we know the starting and ending point for repeating a set of instructions, then we use for loop
	for var in range:
		code

	for var in sequence:
		code
	for num in range(1, 6):
		print(num)


	for I in range(1,5):        ->  1 to 4  i-1,j
		for j in range(1,5):  -> 1 to 4   j=1,2,3,4
			for k in range(1,5)
				print(I," ",j)
	for var in range(start, end, increment)

Q1 . wap to print first 10 even numbers using for loop
	
	if num%2 == 0
Q2. wap to print the multiplication table of a number which user inputs
Q3. wap to print multiplication tables from a start and end value which user inputs,  print table from 5 to 15
2  3  4  5 
4  6  8  10
6  9  12 15 

end="" : to tell the complier for not taking next line when using print() method.
Escape sequence
\t - tab space
\n - new line/next line


2. while loop
while condition:
	code
	inc/dec value

Q1 wap to check whether a number is prime or not?

prime number :
 which is divisible by itself and 1
num=18                
n = 2 to num/2
if number gets divided fully by any number then break 
num%2  = 0 
num/3
num/4
num/5
num/6
num/7
num/8
num/9
if numbers is not divisible by any of the above then It is a prime number


Q3. Wap to input  10 numbers from user and find their sum and average.

run a loop to input 10 values
in this loop, add all of these values into a single variable
after the loops finishes calculate its average and print sum and average both
